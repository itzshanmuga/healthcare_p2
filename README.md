# 🏥 Healthcare Patient Analytics Pipeline

## 🚀 Project Overview

The **Healthcare Patient Analytics Pipeline** is an end-to-end Data Engineering project designed to ingest, transform, validate, and analyze healthcare data for hospital and patient analytics.

The project uses a modern **Lakehouse architecture** with **Azure Data Factory, Azure Data Lake Storage Gen2, Azure Databricks, Delta Lake, Unity Catalog, and dbt** to transform raw healthcare datasets into clean, validated, and analytics-ready data.

The pipeline processes hospital information, patient demographics, diagnosis records, laboratory results, and patient vital measurements through a **Medallion Architecture (Bronze → Silver → Gold)**.

The project focuses on:

* Reliable ingestion of healthcare source data
* Raw data storage and traceability
* Data cleansing and standardization
* Deduplication and validation
* Healthcare business transformations
* Patient risk-score calculation
* Readmission-risk analysis
* Hospital performance analysis
* Laboratory abnormality analysis
* Patient vitals trend analysis
* Healthcare cost analysis
* Data-quality auditing
* Pipeline monitoring and failure alerting
* CI/CD support through Azure DevOps

Validates that `silver_hospital_info` does not contain duplicate:

```text
hospital_id + record_date
```

records.

---

### Gold Mart Validation

The following eight Gold marts are checked to ensure they contain records:

```text
gold_patient_risk_summary
gold_hospital_performance_scorecard
gold_vitals_trend_analysis
gold_cost_analysis
gold_readmission_risk_distribution
gold_lifestyle_health_correlation
gold_lab_abnormality_rate
gold_monthly_quarterly_trend
```

---

# 🔐 Data Governance

The project uses **Databricks Unity Catalog** to manage healthcare data assets.

The architecture separates data into:

```text
bronze
silver
gold
```

Unity Catalog is used for:

* Table management
* External table registration
* Data governance
* Access control
* Data organization
* Lakehouse metadata management

The Bronze layer uses an **External Location and Storage Credential** to access the ADLS Gen2 Parquet data.

# 🔁 CI/CD – Azure DevOps

The project includes an Azure DevOps CI/CD setup.

## Repository Integration

The Databricks workspace is connected to Azure Repos using a Databricks Git folder.

The project code and notebooks can be committed and pushed through the linked Azure DevOps repository.

## Azure Pipeline

The documented pipeline includes:

* Python environment setup
* Pytest installation
* Repository validation
* Test execution
* Build artifact generation
* Artifact publishing

## Service Principal

A service principal named:

```text
Databricks-SP
```

is registered in Microsoft Entra ID to support secure non-interactive deployment access between Azure DevOps and Databricks.

# 📌 Conclusion

The **Healthcare Patient Analytics Pipeline** demonstrates an end-to-end modern Data Engineering solution for transforming healthcare data into reliable and analytics-ready datasets.

The project combines:

**Azure Data Factory → ADLS Gen2 → Databricks → Delta Lake → Unity Catalog → dbt → Gold Analytics → Testing → Monitoring**

to create a structured healthcare analytics platform.

The implementation follows **Medallion Architecture**, separating raw ingestion, data cleansing, and business analytics into Bronze, Silver, and Gold layers.

The Gold layer provides a star-schema-based analytical foundation through:

```text
DIM_PATIENT
DIM_HOSPITAL
DIM_DATE
DIM_OBSERVATION
FACT_HEALTH_METRICS
```

and supports eight business-focused analytical marts covering patient risk, hospital performance, vitals, costs, readmission risk, lifestyle-health relationships, laboratory abnormalities, and monthly/quarterly trends.

The project also incorporates **data-quality audits, automated Pytest validation, Slack failure notifications, Unity Catalog governance, and Azure DevOps CI/CD**, demonstrating the key components of a production-oriented healthcare Data Engineering pipeline.
